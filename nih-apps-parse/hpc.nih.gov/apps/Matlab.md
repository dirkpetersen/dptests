 Description


MATLAB integrates mathematical computing and data visualization in a powerful language to provide a flexible environment for technical computing. The open architecture makes it easy to use MATLAB and its companion products to explore data and create custom tools. MATLAB users benefit from a growing community, pre-written toolboxes containing popular algorithms and analyses, and an integrated development environment (IDE) for writing and debugging code.


**IMPORTANT: (November 2021) Biowulf users now have access to unlimited Matlab licenses and all toolboxes** 
The NIH HPC Staff is pleased to announce a new Matlab license model that provides the following advantages to Biowulf Matlab users: 
(1) access to all Matlab toolboxes,
(2) unlimited number of Matlab licenses,
(3) the ability to run batch jobs without using the Matlab compiler, and
(4) the ability to submit large numbers of Matlab batch jobs.
As before, interactive Matlab jobs are still possible, and are limited to two sinteractive sesssions.
