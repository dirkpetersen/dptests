ACADEMIC USER AGREEMENT
------------------------



**Repbase Update** is a Database of Repetitive DNA published by
Genetic Information Research Institute. You may download
the content of the Database free of charge under the following
conditions:

1. You agree **NOT** to make the **Repbase Update** (or any part thereof, 
including **Repbase Reports**, **Repeat Maps** 
and other derived materials, modified or not) 
available to anyone outside your research group. "Make available" includes
leaving the data where it may be accessible to outside individuals
without your direct knowledge (e.g. on a computer to which people
outside your group have login privileges), as well as directly
providing it to someone. Refer any requests for the Database
to GIRI ([http://www.girinst.org](http://www.girinst.org/)).

- You agree **NOT** to use the **Repbase Update** for commercially
restricted sequencing and/or proprietary sequence analysis.
Commercially restricted sequencing is defined as sequencing for which
a company retains patenting or licensing rights regarding the sequence,
or the right to restrict or delay dissemination of the sequence; 
with the sole exception that sequencing is not considered to be commercially
restricted if it is federally funded and the investigators adopt the
data release policies endorsed at the Wellcome Trust-sponsored Bermuda
meeting, i.e. immediate release of data as it is generated).  

       
If you are doing commercially restricted sequencing or other proprietary
activities involving any portion of **Repbase Update** see the
instructions at the [this page](http://www.girinst.org/accountservices/register.php).

- You agree to properly cite the Database and its specific, original contributions if directly related to your work (see [References](http://www.girinst.org/repbase/update/howtocite.html) for details).  

  
- You certify that you are authorized to accept this agreement on behalf
of your institution.

- All members of your group with access to the Database agree to the
same conditions.
