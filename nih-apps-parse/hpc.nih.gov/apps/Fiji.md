Fiji is a distribution of the popular open-source software ImageJ focused on biological-image analysis. Fiji uses modern software engineering practices to combine powerful software libraries with a broad range of scripting languages to enable rapid prototyping of image-processing algorithms. Fiji facilitates the transformation of new algorithms into ImageJ plugins that can be shared with end users through an integrated update system.

Interactive job
[Interactive jobs](/docs/userguide.html#int) should be used for debugging, graphics, or applications that cannot be run as batch jobs.
Allocate an [interactive session](/docs/userguide.html#int) and run the program. You should see the Fiji logo appear, and then the Fiji console window.   

In order to use Fiji,
you have to create [graphical X11 connection](https://hpc.nih.gov/docs/connect.html) to Biowulf.   

Both MobaXterm (recommended) and NX will work for Windows users, while XQuartz works well for Mac users.

   

Sample session:



```

[user@biowulf]$ **sinteractive**
[user@@cn3316 ~]$ **module load Fiji** 
[user@@cn3316 ~]$ **fiji &**

```
