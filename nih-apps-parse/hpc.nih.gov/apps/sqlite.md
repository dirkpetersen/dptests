SQLite


Description
SQLite is a file-based RDMBS. It is appropriate for simple and reliable
database management by a few simultaneous users. It is not appropriate for
highly-distributed access due to file-locking restrictions.


Modules are available for the following versions:


* 3.38.5
* 3.34.1
* 3.32.3
* 3.22.0
* 3.15.0


Strangely enough, sqlite can be called with the command



sqlite3

For detailed documentation about the command line client and the C
API see the [SQLite home page](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html).
