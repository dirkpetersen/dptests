<p class="appDesc">Atom is a modern desktop text editor. The stated
  goal is a zero-compromise combination of hackability and usability: an
  editor that will be welcoming to an elementary school student on their
  first day learning to code, but also a tool they won't outgrow as they
  develop into seasoned hackers. Atom is a specialized variant of
  Chromium designed to be a text editor rather than a web browser. Every
  Atom window is essentially a locally-rendered web page.</p>

<p class="appDesc">To run Atom, you must use a graphical connection to Biowulf, set up an <a href="https://hpc.nih.gov/docs/userguide.html#int">interactive session</a>, and load the <tt>atom</tt> <a href="https://hpc.nih.gov/apps/modules.html">module</a> before executing the <tt>atom</tt> command.

<p class="appDesc">When you launch Atom for the first time, you should
  get a screen presenting several options for documentation and for
  customization and operation of the editor.  Atom's primary
  documentation is the [<a href="http://flight-manual.atom.io/">Atom
  Flight Manual</a>], including its [<a
