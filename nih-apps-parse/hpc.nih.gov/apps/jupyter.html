<p>Jupyter is an open-source web application that allows you to create and
share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and
explanatory text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical
simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning and much more.  </p>

<p>We try to maintain Jupyter kernel configurations for all of our system Python and R modules.
If you require additional kernels or the use of custom environments, you can 
<a href=https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/install/kernels.html>add your own kernels</a>
to your personal configuration.</p>

<p>New versions may add or remove minor additional features or integrations not mentioned on
this page depending on compatibility with newer versions of core packages.</p>

<a Name="pitfalls"></a><div class="heading">Common pitfalls</div>

<p>This is a list of common pitfalls for jupyter users on the cluster. Some of these
are discussed in other sections of this documentation in more detail.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Running jupyter-notebook on the biowulf login node</dt>
<dd>It is considered bad form to run jupyter-notebook on the login node.  Please
allocate an interactive session to use jupyter-notebook.</dd>

<dt>Unable to use R magic with python kernels</dt>
<dd>If the rpy2 module is not loaded before starting the jupyter notebook
    <code>%load_ext rpy2.ipython`</code> causes an error. To fix please restart
    jupyter <em>after</em> loading the rpy2 module</dd>

<dt>PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/run/user/xxxx'</dt>
<dd>This can be fixed by unsetting the <code>$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</code> variable:
<pre class="term">
$ unset XDG_RUNTIME_DIR    # (bash)
$ unsetenv XDG_RUNTIME_DIR # (tcsh)
</pre>
The cause of this error is the <code>$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</code> variable
exported from the login node pointing to a non-existing directory on the 
compute node. This appears to be a problem under only some circumstances.
</dd>

<dt>Expected packages are missing from my python kernel</dt>
<dd>Jupyter itself is installed as a conda environment and is
the default kernel for new notebooks. This environment, however,
does not include the commonly used scientific stack of packages.
Instead, please use one of the kernels corresponding to the
centrally installed applications (e.g. python/3.10).</dd>

<dt>Other python modules</dt>
<dd>No python or R modules need to be loaded. The main python
and R installations are available as pre-configured kernels in
our jupyter setup.</dd>

<dt>Unable to export PDF</dt>
<dd>Using the built-in nbconvert to export notebooks to PDF may fail
with the error: "nbconvert failed: xelatex not found on PATH".
To fix this, load the <code>tex</code> module.</dd>
</dl>



<a Name="general"></a><div class="heading">Starting a Jupyter Instance and connecting from your local browser</div>

<p><strong>Please see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgLJb1anNPA">our Jupyter on Biowulf video</a>
for both a quick start and detailed video guide</strong> to connecting to Jupyter running in a
compute node interactive session. The video shows a Windows client but is equally applicable to macOS or Linux.</p>

<p>
In order to connect to a Jupyter Notebook running on a compute node with the browser on
your computer, it is necessary to establish a tunnel from your computer to
biowulf and from biowulf to the compute node. 
<a href="/docs/userguide.html#int">sinteractive</a> can automatically
create the second leg of this tunnel (from biowulf to the compute node) when started with
the <code>-T/--tunnel</code> option. For more details and information on how to set up the
second part of the tunnel see our <a href="/docs/tunneling/">tunneling documentation.</a>
</p>

<p><b>Successfully accessing Jupyter on the cluster from your browser is a three step process.
    You must ensure that you do all of the following:</b></p>

<ol>
    <li>Start your sinteractive session with the <code>-T</code>/<code>--tunnel</code>
        option. When you start this session up it will give you a specific
        command you can use to access one port on that compute node in the format: <code>ssh -L
        #####:localhost:##### user@biowulf.nih.gov</code></li>
    <li>Start the Jupyter Lab session with --port $PORT1. This will make sure
        Jupyter is listening on the port that is being forwarded.</li>
    <li>In a <b>separate terminal session</b> from your computer, run the full <code>ssh
        -L</code> command from step 1. This is what allows your local browser to actually talk to
        the Jupyter server on the compute node (forwarding that web traffic from
        your local machine, through Biowulf, to the compute node), otherwise,
        you will get a connection refused error.</li>
</ol>

<p class="hl">
Note that the python environment hosting the jupyter install is a minimal
python environment. Please use the fully featured kernels named similarly
to their modules (e.g. python/3.10 or R/4.3). The kernels set up their environment
so there is no need to load separate R or python modules before starting jupyter.
</p>

<p>Allocate an <a href="/docs/userguide.html#int">interactive session</a> and
start a jupyter instance as shown below. First, we launch <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki">tmux</a> (or <a
href="https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">screen</a>) on the login node so
that we don't lose our session if our connection to the login node drops.</li>

directly. Brief explanation of the options:</p>

    <dt><code>notebook|lab|console</code></dt>
    <dd>Start a jupyter notebook, jupyter lab, or jupyter console</dd>
    <dt><code>--ip localhost</code></dt>

    <dt><code>--port $PORT1</code></dt>
    <dd>listen on <code>$PORT1</code>, the variable set when using <code>--tunnel</code> for sinteractive</dd>
    <dt><code>--no-browser</code></dt>
    <dd>We're not running the browser on the compute node!</dd>

<h3>Selecting a kernel</h3>

<p><strong>In the notebook interface</strong> the kernels highlighted in red below correspond
to the equally named modules on the command line interface. Note that no modules other than
jupyter has to be loaded - the kernels do all the required setup:</p>

<div style="margin: 0 auto; width:70%">
   <img src="/images/jupyter_notebook_kernels.png" alt="Select notebook kernels" width="100%"/> 
</div>

<p>Similarly, <strong>in the Jupyter Lab interface</strong></p>

<div style="margin: 0 auto; width:70%">
   <img src="/images/jupyter_lab_kernels.png" alt="Select lab kernels" width="100%"/> 
</div>

<p>Kernels may change as new python or R installations are added or old ones are retired. Look
for kernels with the same name as command line modules.</p>
