Writing bisulfite genomes out into a single MFA (multi FastA) file

Bisulfite Genome Indexer version v0.16.0 (last modified 25 August 2015)


Step I - Prepare genome folders - completed



Total number of conversions performed:
C-&gtT:	34912524
G-&gtA:	35019119

Step II - Genome bisulfite conversions - completed


Bismark Genome Preparation - Step III: Launching the Bowtie 2 indexer
Please be aware that this process can - depending on genome size - take several hours!
