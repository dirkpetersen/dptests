 *** Bismark methylation extractor version v0.16.0 ***

Trying to determine the type of mapping from the SAM header line of file test_data_bismark_bt2.bam
Treating file(s) as single-end data (as extracted from @PG line)

Setting core usage to single-threaded (default). Consider using --multicore &ltint&gt to speed up the extraction process.

Summarising Bismark methylation extractor parameters:
===============================================================
Bismark single-end SAM format specified (default)
Number of cores to be used: 1
Output will be written to the current directory ('/spin1/users/user/bismark_test')
