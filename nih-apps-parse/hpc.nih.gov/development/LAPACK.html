<div class="title">LAPACK</div>

    <p><a href="http://www.netlib.org/lapack/">LAPACK</a> provides routines for
solving systems of simultaneous linear equations, least-squares solutions of
linear systems of equations, eigenvalue problems, and singular value
problems.</p>

    <p>LAPACK routines are written so that as much as possible of the
computation is performed by calls to the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (<a
href="http://www.netlib.org/blas/">BLAS</a>).</p>

    <p>To view the available versions of LAPACK, type:</p>
    <div class="term">module avail LAPACK</div>

    <p>LAPACK is built with both static and shared libraries.  There are two
versions of the static library available: one with position-independent code
(PIC) and one without.  To compile a program with the static library with PIC,
include the following library at compile time:</p>

    <div class="term">gcc -llapack_pic ...</div>

    <p>Within LAPACK, the BLAS static library is not built with -fPIC.  As a
result, your code compilation may return an error such as:</p>

    <div class="term">"...libblas.a(symbol) relocation R_X86_64_32 against
`.rodata' can not be used when making a shared object; recompile with
-fPIC."</div>

    <p>You can avoid the error above by explicitly specifying the shared
library instead of at compile time:</p>
    <div class="term">gcc -l:libblas.so.3 ...</div>

<div class="subheading"><h4>Compiled Libraries</h4></div>

LAPACK installs the following libraries:

<pre>lib/libblas.a           => static blas library 
lib/libblas.so.3.5.0    => shared library (with PIC)

lib/liblapack.a         => static lapack library
lib/liblapack_pic.a     => static lapack library (with PIC)
lib/liblapack.so.3.5.0  => shared lapack library (with PIC)
</pre>
