  <p>Autotools is a part of the GNU build system and is a set of tools,
  including automake, autoconf and libtool, that are used to build packages.
  These tools are involved in the typical <span class="monospace">configure; make;
  make install</span> sequence when building applications from source.</p>
  
  <p><a
  href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf.html">Autoconf</a>,
  for example, mostly focuses on producing <span
  class="monospace">configure</span> scripts.  <a
  href="http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/automake.html">Automake</a>
  is used for generating <span class="monospace">Makefile.in</span> files and
  along with the <span class="monospace">configure</span> script are used to
  produce <span class="monospace">Makefiles</span>. Other tools include
  aclocal, autoheader, and autoscan.  Some related tools that are frequently
  used alongside the Autotools utilities are make, gettext, pkg-config and GCC,
  which together comprise the GNU toolchain.</p>

  <p>You may need to use Autotools for either generating your own configure
  script and Makefiles.  Additionally, you may need to use Autotools when
  building other applications.<p>

  <p>The system defaults of these various tools are installed on the login and
  compute nodes.  These versions are packaged by the vendor (Red Hat/CentOS)
  and tend to be out of date.  If your program requires newer versions
  of these tools, load the <i>automake</i> module:</p>

  <div class="term">module load automake</div>

  <p>Loading the <i>automake</i> module will also load newer versions
  of autoconf, m4 and libtool since these tools are often used together.
  Optionally, you may load these tools individually, for example:</p>

  <pre class="term">module load autoconf/2.69
module load m4/1.4.17
module load libtool/2.4.6
</pre>
