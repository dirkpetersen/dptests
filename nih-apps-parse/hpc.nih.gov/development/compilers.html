<div class="title">Compiler Suites</div>

<p> All compute nodes on the Biowulf cluster include the GCC compiler suite,
which includes C, C++, FORTRAN77 and FORTRAN90/95 compilers (gcc, g++, g77 and
  gfortran respectively) along with the GNU debugger (gdb). In addition to the 
  default compilers, the Intel compiler suite is also available, which may improve the performance of your project.
   
<div class="subheading"><h4>GNU Compilers</h4></div>
<p>The GNU compiler suite is available in the user's PATH by default. This is
the system default version that comes with the operating system. Though not
considered "high-performance" or "optimized," they are usually the best choice
for pre-existing source codes since build-systems are often created with this
compiler in mind (indeed, a lot of code will run faster using GCC unless pains
have been taken to include optimal flags for the various proprietary
compilers). Consequently, sensible compiler flags are generated and building
will be comparatively trouble-free with these build-systems. However, if
performance is an issue, you should consult the documentation distributed with
the source distribution that you're trying to build to see if other compilers
are supported. If you're developing a high-performance application "in-house,"
you may want to explore the other compilers available on Biowulf.</p>

<p>Some users need the latest features offered by the latest release of the GNU
compiler suite, so we also maintain newer GCC releases. These newer
GNU compilers require newer environment variables set before executing programs
built with it. This is accomplished by loading the appropriate module.
Alternatively, the user can specify "-static-libgcc", "-static-libgfortran" or
"-static--libg++" (depending on the language) during the build phase to
compile-in these runtimes and thus avoid needing to set different runtime
paths.</p>

<p>To view the available versions of GCC, run:<p>
<div class="term">module avail gcc</div>

<p>More documentation is available on the <a
href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/">GNU website</a>.</p>

<div class="subheading" id="intel"><h4>Intel Compilers</h4></div>
<p>The Intel suite includes C, C+, FORTRAN77 and FORTRAN90/95 compilers along
with OpenMP and the Intel debugger. Anecdotal evidence suggests that this
compiler suite frequently provides the best performance for
calculation-intensive applications. Included with these compilers are the Intel
Math Kernel Library (MKL), LINPACK and Intel Performance Primitives (IPP) - all
discussed in the scientific libraries section below.</p>                       

<p>To view the available versions of the Intel compilers, run:<p>
<div class="term">module avail intel</div>

<p>More documentation is available on the <a
href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-parallel-studio-xe-support/documentation"
>Intel website</a>.</p>
