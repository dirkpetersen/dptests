I have a folder full of Microsoft Word documents. These documents have certain terms that I want to highlight with yellow color.  The terms come from a text file forbidden-fruits.txt and there's one term per line.  If a term has a space also search for the term where the space is replaced with a hyphen and where the space is removed alltogether, please search Case insensitive, please only mark whole words and not parts of words, please write a script that I can call with a folder name and the forbidden-fruits.txt file
