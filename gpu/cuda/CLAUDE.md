I have a Nvidia DGX Machine with 8xH200 which has Cuda 12.4 installed, Driver Version: 550.144.03. The OS is "Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS"

Write me some cuda code that allows me to specify the number of GPUs to use.This code should run some sort of benchmark and utilize the all compute as well as memory capacity of the GPUs selected. It should run up to to one minute
